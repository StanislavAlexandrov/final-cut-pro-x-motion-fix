# Final Cut Pro X Plugin Fixer

<https://stanislavalexandrov.github.io/final-cut-pro-x-motion-fix/>

After the 10.4.8 release of Final Cut Pro X some plugins (titles, generators) stopped working showing the red 'missing font' icon.

This happens because some separator layers are not readable by newer versions of FCPX or Motion.

This script is intended to fix this issue by removing said layers.

**This is very much early beta, use it at your own risk.**
