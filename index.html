  <h1>Final Cut Pro X Plugin Fixer</h1>
  <p>After the 10.4.8 release of Final Cut Pro X some plugins (titles, generators) stopped working showing the red 'missing font' icon. 
      This happens because some separator layers are not readable by newer versions of FCPX or Motion. 
      This script is intended to fix this issue by removing said layers.

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Click 'Choose file' and find the title that is not working in your /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Movies/Motion Templates/Titles... folder. It will have the .moti extension.</li>
      <li>Save it as a copy in the same folder.</li>
      <li>Restart Final Cut Pro X if running and test if the title file is working.</li>
      <li>If all goes well, replace the older .moti file with the patched one.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>Important:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This is very much early beta, use it at your own risk.</li>
      <li>Always save the patched file as a copy first, you never know what could go wrong.</li>
      <li>It probably only works in Chrome and Chromium based browser as it uses the File System Access API.</li>
    </ul>
